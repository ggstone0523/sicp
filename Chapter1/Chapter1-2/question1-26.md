# Answer

### 1.
    Louis's method, compared to the existing method, is to change a linear recursive procedure to a tree recursive procedure when it is even. 
    In conclusion, the linear proportional algorithm was transformed into an exponential proportional algorithm when even, 
    which means that the overall algorithm was also changed from log proportional to linear proportional.
